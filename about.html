        <h1>About Our Group</h1>

        <h2>Group Description</h2>
        <p>We are a team of six individuals who came together to create this preliminary activity for Web Design and Development Lab instructed by Sir Harold Jefferson Gomez.</p>

        <h2>Reflection on Teamwork</h2>
        <p>As this is our first group activity in the Web Design and Development Lab, we worked hard to establish effective communication and collaboration among ourselves. We divided the tasks equally and fairly. This experience has not only strengthened our teamwork skills but also given us a deeper understanding of how web design projects are created in a real-world context. We're excited to continue building on this foundation as we dive deeper into web development concepts and techniques in future projects.</p>
