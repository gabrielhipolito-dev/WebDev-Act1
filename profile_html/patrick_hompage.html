        Hi! My name is Patrick Pacoma, and I was born on June 12, 2003. I grew up curious about how things work, especially gadgets and computers. Ever since I was a kid, I loved tinkering with devices and figuring out how to fix them when they broke. That curiosity turned into a passion that shaped the path I’m on today.
Right now, I’m taking up Computer Engineering, which is both challenging and exciting. I enjoy learning about programming, circuits, and how hardware and software come together to create the technology we use every day. My goal is to become an engineer who can design innovative solutions that make life easier for people.
Outside of school, I like spending my time playing video games, listening to music, and exploring new tech trends. I also enjoy hanging out with friends and going on spontaneous trips when I can. Life’s a mix of coding, fun, and new adventures and I wouldn’t have it any other way.
