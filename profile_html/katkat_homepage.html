        Hey everyone! My name is Katrine Rose Balite, but you can just call me Katkat. I'm 22 years old and currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering at Adamson University. I've always been fascinated by technology and how things work behind the scenes, which is one of the main reasons I chose this field. When I'm not buried in textbooks or coding assignments, I like to unwind by playing video games—it's a great way for me to relax and challenge myself. I’m a huge fan of immersive RPGs and strategy games, but I’ll play almost anything that has a good storyline.

Aside from gaming, I’m also a huge fan of documentaries and anime series. I love learning about new topics through documentaries—especially those about technology, history, or science. Anime, on the other hand, is my escape from the everyday. I’m always on the lookout for new series to binge-watch, whether it’s action-packed or has a deep emotional storyline. It’s a perfect way for me to wind down after a busy day.

I’m constantly curious and always looking for ways to expand my knowledge, whether through school, hobbies, or just exploring new interests. I’m excited about the future and the opportunities ahead, and I’m always open to meeting like-minded people who share similar passions. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about tech, gaming, or even share some cool anime recommendations!
